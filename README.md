# Vulnerability-Lookup Sighting

A client that retrieves vulnerability observations from a [MISP](https://github.com/MISP/MISP) server and pushes them to a
[Vulnerability Lookup](https://github.com/cve-search/vulnerability-lookup) instance.

Similar to [FediVuln](https://github.com/CIRCL/FediVuln) which is using the Fediverse as a source of observations.
